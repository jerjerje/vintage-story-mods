But if you had an unattuned tuning cylinder, I would gladly create a copy for you. I have recorded many songs on my own resonator. Including of course my own: \"Substitute For An Epitaph\". I truly cannot recommend it enough. Additionaly I could also offer the seasonal songs from this village. Or maybe you would prefer a song from further away? I could offer one from a village located in the cold and frigid north. Or how about a song from a village on top of a windy cliff? Which one would you like?",
